    <p><span style="font-size: 26px"> We develop an approach for physically based facial simulation. We collect facial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from Memorial Surrey Hospital. We collect camera scans of facial samples as well. The facial template is given. The goal is to use the principles of deformation, and biomechanics, to register the template to the MRI scans, apply the scanned facial texture, and finally generate the personalized facial simulation, as shown in Fig. 1. We use interpolating to allow the simulation to generate arbitrary poses that a face can have. Finally, we will output the generated animation, and compare it with some unseen MRI scans which are the ground truth of the experiments, to evaluate the accuracy of the approach.</span></p>
